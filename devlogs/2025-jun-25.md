# June 25, 2025 - Remdesk Channel Integration

## What I Did Today

### Problem Found
- `freerdp_client_context_new` function needs remdesk channel
- remdesk channel not included in vcpkg FreeRDP libraries
- Got linking errors when trying to use the function

### What is remdesk Channel
- Remote Desktop channel for RDP protocol
- Handles screen sharing and remote control
- Required for FreeRDP client context creation

### Solution Implemented
1. **Imported remdesk source files** from FreeRDP repository
2. **Created channels directory structure** in project root
3. **Added source files to CMakeLists.txt**

### Files Added
```
channels/remdesk/
├── client/remdesk_main.c
├── client/remdesk_main.h  
├── common/remdesk_common.c
└── common/remdesk_common.h
```

### CMakeLists.txt Changes
```cmake
set(SOURCES
    main.c
    client/client.c
    client/client_hooks.c
    channels/remdesk/common/remdesk_common.c  # Added
    channels/remdesk/client/remdesk_main.c    # Added
    errors/error.c
)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/channels/remdesk/common  # Added
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/channels/remdesk/client  # Added
        # ...existing includes...
)
```

### Result
- Fixed linking errors
- `freerdp_client_context_new` now works
- Build system uses vcpkg libraries + manual remdesk sources

## Client Implementation Progress

### client_start Function
Implemented the client start function that:
1. **Checks hostname** - Validates server hostname is provided
2. **Creates thread** - Spawns client_thread for RDP operations

```c
static int client_start(rdpContext* context){
    clientContext* clicon = (clientContext*)context;
    rdpSettings* settings = context->settings;

    if (!freerdp_settings_get_string(settings, FreeRDP_ServerHostname))
    {
        WLog_ERR(TAG, "error: server hostname was not specified with /v:<server>[:port]");
        return -1;
    }

    if (!(clicon->common.thread = CreateThread(NULL, 0, client_thread, context->instance, 0, NULL)))
    {
        WLog_ERR(TAG, "failed to create client thread");
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### client_thread Function
Created the main client thread that:
1. **Attempts connection** - Calls `freerdp_connect(instance)`
2. **Starts client loop** - Enters event handling loop after successful connection

### Function Call Flow Discovered
Through testing, found the execution sequence:

1. **global_init** - Called first for global initialization
2. **client_new** - Called to set up client context and hooks
3. **client_start** - Called to start the client thread
4. **client_thread** - Thread starts and calls `freerdp_connect`
5. **preConnect hook** - Called after `freerdp_connect` begins connection process

```c
// Call sequence observed:
client_global_init called
client_new called  
client_start called
client_thread called
// freerdp_connect() internally calls:
pre_connect called
```

This shows how FreeRDP manages the client lifecycle and when custom hooks are triggered during the connection process.
