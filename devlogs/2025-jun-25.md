# June 25, 2025 - Remdesk Channel Integration

## What I Did Today

### Problem Found
- `freerdp_client_context_new` function needs remdesk channel
- remdesk channel not included in vcpkg FreeRDP libraries
- Got linking errors when trying to use the function

### What is remdesk Channel
- Remote Desktop channel for RDP protocol
- Handles screen sharing and remote control
- Required for FreeRDP client context creation

### Solution Implemented
1. **Imported remdesk source files** from FreeRDP repository
2. **Created channels directory structure** in project root
3. **Added source files to CMakeLists.txt**

### Files Added
```
channels/remdesk/
├── client/remdesk_main.c
├── client/remdesk_main.h  
├── common/remdesk_common.c
└── common/remdesk_common.h
```

### CMakeLists.txt Changes
```cmake
set(SOURCES
    main.c
    client/client.c
    client/client_hooks.c
    channels/remdesk/common/remdesk_common.c  # Added
    channels/remdesk/client/remdesk_main.c    # Added
    errors/error.c
)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/channels/remdesk/common  # Added
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/channels/remdesk/client  # Added
        # ...existing includes...
)
```

### Result
- Fixed linking errors
- `freerdp_client_context_new` now works
- Build system uses vcpkg libraries + manual remdesk sources
